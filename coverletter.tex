\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}

I'm a second-year master's student at Virginia Tech. I'm planning to graduate by the beginning of 2021, and I'm interested in Software Engineering. My thesis is about generating synthetic Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) using Deep Learning (Generative Adversarial Networks) to mitigate privacy issues and limited availability in healthcare datasets. I have worked for five years as a Software Engineer in a high-tech company's Infrastructure team, providing service to more than 40 million users. I'm an expert in Distributed Object Storage and CDN Systems.

\lettersection{Why Google?}

I stayed at Café Bazaar, Iran's largest application store, for more than five years because it had a fantastic work environment filled with outstanding people. Google is known to have an excellent workplace for its brilliant employees. Besides, I always wanted to be part of a company that creates incredible products. Google has a lot of original products; some products like Google Stadia are fascinating to me because of its new and technical challenges due to its realtime nature. I'm looking to become a full-time software engineer after my graduation by December 2020, and I want to use this summer to get additional experience working at a tech giant like Google.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

I have over five years of experience as a software developer. I'm enthusiastic about working with new technologies and always eager to learn. I'm experienced in distributed object storage systems like Redhat's Ceph and Rados Gateway. I'm an expert in Linux, and I've been a system administrator of CDN and DNS systems. I have a good background in algorithms, and I've participated in regional ACM content. Being a part of different groups on various products for five years made me believe that to succeed, I need to be patience, collaborative, and committed to my team.
